# Data Analysis

This experimental repository holds a set of data analyses performed using the [FRACTR](https://smokenmaps.com) maps & data.

Currently, the repository contains a breakdown of population density and median household income in Vermont by response time area. The analysis is available here: [https://fractr-app.github.io/Data-Analysis/](https://fractr-app.github.io/Data-Analysis/)

Important Note: these analyses are experimental and are only representative. John is a novel student of data science and his work merits a careful look-over before use in a remotely-professional setting. John hopes that this analysis is informative and can, at the very last, help spark questions & discussion.
